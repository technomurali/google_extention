2. [ ] Change voice in Audio Settings - does it persist?
3. [ ] Change theme in Appearance - does it apply?
4. [ ] Toggle "Show Help on Load" - does it work on reload?
5. [ ] Change History max results - does it affect search?
6. [ ] Close and reopen settings - are all changes saved?

If all smoke tests pass, proceed with full test suite.
